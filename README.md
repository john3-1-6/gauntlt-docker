# gauntlt-docker
The docker for gauntlt

## How it works
It is purposely made to get started with security testing with gauntlt. There are a couple things we do here that are a bit different.

- Arachni and nikto are installed inside this container
- Gauntlt is installed and is set as the entrypoint

Feel free to fork this and customize for your needs. This container is great to put into a CI/CD pipeline and many people use it for this purpose.

## Setup

1. Build the docker container


2. Test it out with a `gauntlt --help`


## Have fun!
